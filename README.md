## Overview

SelXPress is an online marketplace platform. It offers a front office interface accessible to customers, a back office interface accessible to sellers and operators, and an API to manage data transit.

The SelXPress front office offers customers secure, user-friendly access to a variety of products. Users can browse a comprehensive list of items, filter results according to their preferences, view detailed product sheets, add items to their shopping cart, make secure payments and view their order history.

The SelXPress back office is reserved for sales staff and operators. It enables them to manage their products, manage inventory and track comments and reviews. The back office also provides additional functionalities for operators, such as user management, and other administrative tasks linked to marketplace management.

With SelXPress, customers can enjoy a convenient and secure online shopping experience, while sellers and operators benefit from dedicated access to manage their sales activities and ensure the smooth running of the marketplace.
